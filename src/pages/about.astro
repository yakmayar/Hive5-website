            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Welcome to Hive Five Apiary! We are passionate hobby beekeepers located in Midtown Raleigh, North Carolina. Our journey into beekeeping began in 2018 when I took a series of classes offered through an NC State grant for the high school where I worked. We wanted to transform our suburban yard into a little homestead, starting with expanding our garden, getting chickens, and rethinking our approach to yard maintenance.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              We had a fascination with honey bees and wanted to help our community wildlife flourish. While beekeeping is a significant investment, it has grown into a rewarding practice that connects us with nature and our community.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Every ounce of honey the bees collect tells a story of the flowers they visited, the seasons they weathered, and the care we put into maintaining healthy, thriving hives. We believe in sustainable beekeeping practices that prioritize the wellbeing of our bees while sharing the fruits of their labor with our neighbors.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              As urban beekeepers in Raleigh, we're proud to contribute to the local ecosystem. Our bees forage on the diverse flora of the North Hills area, creating honey with unique flavors that reflect our neighborhood's botanical diversity.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              We practice natural beekeeping methods, minimizing intervention and letting the bees do what they do best. Our small-scale operation allows us to give each hive the individual attention it deserves, ensuring healthy colonies and the highest quality honey for our community.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              We are active members of the North Carolina and Wake County Beekeepers' Associations, as well as various beekeeping Facebook groups. We enjoy connecting with other beekeepers in the area, learning from their experience, and sharing amazing facts about how honey bees operate.
